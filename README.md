## Introduction

This project showcases a simple and responsive card layout that adjusts based on the device's screen size. Each card contains an image, a name, title, short description, and social media icons.

## Features

**Responsive Design**: The cards adjust to different screen sizes.
**Social Media Icons**: Each card includes links to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
**Customizable Content**: You can easily update the card content such as the name, title, and description.

## HTML_usage

In this project, we use both **semantic** and **non-semantic** HTML elements. Below is a table that categorizes them:

# CSS Properties Differentiation: Width and Height

This document explains the differences between common CSS properties related to width and height, including `width`, `min-width`, `max-width`, `height`, `min-height`, and `max-height`. It provides a beginner-friendly explanation along with a differentiation table.

## CSS Properties Differentiation Table (Width and Height-related)

| **Property**        | **Description**                                                                 | **Example Usage**                                    | **Behavior/Impact**                                             | **Symmetric or Asymmetric** |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **`width`**          | Defines the exact width of an element.                                           | `width: 200px;` or `width: 50%;`                     | Sets a fixed or percentage width for an element.                | Asymmetric (based on value)  |
| **`min-width`**      | Defines the minimum width an element can have.                                   | `min-width: 150px;`                                  | Ensures the element is at least this width, but can grow larger if needed. | Asymmetric (minimum limit)   |
| **`max-width`**      | Defines the maximum width an element can have.                                   | `max-width: 500px;`                                  | Ensures the element doesn't grow beyond this width, but can shrink smaller if needed. | Asymmetric (maximum limit)   |
| **`height`**         | Defines the exact height of an element.                                          | `height: 300px;` or `height: 60%;`                   | Sets a fixed or percentage height for an element.               | Asymmetric (based on value)  |
| **`min-height`**     | Defines the minimum height an element can have.                                  | `min-height: 100px;`                                 | Ensures the element is at least this height, but can grow larger if needed. | Asymmetric (minimum limit)   |
| **`max-height`**     | Defines the maximum height an element can have.                                  | `max-height: 400px;`                                 | Ensures the element doesn't grow taller than this height, but can shrink smaller if needed. | Asymmetric (maximum limit)   |

## Brief Explanation for Beginners

### **`width`**:
- This is the width of an element. You can set it in pixels, percentages, or other units.
- If you set `width: 200px;`, the element will always be 200 pixels wide.

### **`min-width`**:
- This defines the minimum width the element can shrink to. If content inside grows, the element can expand beyond this value.
- If you set `min-width: 150px;`, the element cannot be smaller than 150 pixels, but it can grow if the content requires it.

### **`max-width`**:
- This defines the maximum width the element can have. It can shrink if the content inside the element is smaller.
- If you set `max-width: 500px;`, the element will never exceed 500px in width, but can shrink if needed.

### **`height`**:
- This is the fixed height of an element. You can set it in pixels, percentages, or other units.
- If you set `height: 300px;`, the element will always be 300 pixels tall.

### **`min-height`**:
- This defines the minimum height an element can have. The element can grow taller than this value if necessary.
- If you set `min-height: 100px;`, the element cannot be shorter than 100px, but it can grow taller if the content is larger.

### **`max-height`**:
- This defines the maximum height the element can have. It can shrink if the content inside is smaller.
- If you set `max-height: 400px;`, the element will not grow taller than 400px but can shrink if the content allows it.

## Key Differences

### **`width` vs `min-width` vs `max-width`**:
- **`width`** is the exact width you set.
- **`min-width`** ensures the element doesnâ€™t get smaller than the set value but can grow if needed.
- **`max-width`** ensures the element doesnâ€™t grow beyond the set value but can shrink if needed.

### **`height` vs `min-height` vs `max-height`**:
- **`height`** is the exact height you set.
- **`min-height`** ensures the element doesnâ€™t get shorter than the set value but can grow if necessary.
- **`max-height`** ensures the element doesnâ€™t grow taller than the set value but can shrink if needed.

This table and explanation should help you understand how these properties work in CSS to control the size of elements on a webpage.
