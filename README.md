## Introduction

This project showcases a simple and responsive card layout that adjusts based on the device's screen size. Each card contains an image, a name, title, short description, and social media icons.

## Features

**Responsive Design**: The cards adjust to different screen sizes.
**Social Media Icons**: Each card includes links to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
**Customizable Content**: You can easily update the card content such as the name, title, and description.

## HTML_usage
